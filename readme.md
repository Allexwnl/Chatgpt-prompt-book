ChatAI Web Application
This is a web-based application that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3 (or ChatGPT) to create, store, and interact with various AI-generated prompts. The app supports different categories like coding, math, history, geography, and more. It also provides functionality for user login, prompt creation, and saving.

Features
Login & Register: Allows users to create accounts and log in.
Prompt Creation: Users can create custom prompts and save them.
Prompt Categories: Categories like Coding, Math, Geography, and more are supported.
ChatGPT Interaction: Prompts can be sent directly to ChatGPT for interaction.
Sticky Navbar: Navbar remains fixed at the top with smooth scroll behavior.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Requirements
A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
An internet connection (for ChatGPT integration)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Code kopiëren
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatAI.git
cd ChatAI
2. Set up the Project
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX for communication with a backend. Ensure your backend is set up correctly (e.g., a PHP server for API requests).

3. Backend Setup (Data.php)
You'll need to have a backend API (Data.php) to handle requests such as:

LogInCheck: Verify user login status.
getPrompts: Fetch available prompts from the database.
pushPrompt: Save new prompts created by users.
checkIfUser: Check if a user exists and authenticate login.
pushUser: Create a new user account.
Ensure that Data.php is properly configured to connect to your database and handle these requests.

4. Frontend Setup
The frontend is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which provide the interactive UI. You can simply open the index.html in any browser or serve it using a local server.

bash
Code kopiëren
# Using Python's built-in HTTP server (for local testing):
python3 -m http.server 8000

5. Additional Steps (Optional)
Ensure that the manifest.json is properly configured if you wish to deploy the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
Set up the correct API endpoints in Data.php to handle AJAX requests.
Customize the look and feel by modifying the CSS files in the project.

Usage
Login:

Visit the login page and enter your username and password.
Once logged in, you'll be redirected to the homepage where you can interact with prompts.
Create a Prompt:

Navigate to the "Create Prompt" section and enter a prompt title, description, and select a category.
Once submitted, the prompt is stored and can be viewed under the "My Prompts" section.
Interact with ChatGPT:

You can send any prompt to ChatGPT by clicking the "Ask ChatGPT" button next to the prompt.
This will open a ChatGPT interface in a new tab for real-time interaction.
Example Use Case
Category Selection: When you visit the coding category page, the app will display all coding-related prompts.
Prompt Filtering: Prompts are dynamically loaded from the backend based on the selected category.
ChatGPT Interaction: You can click a prompt to open it and ask ChatGPT to process it for you.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX)
Backend: PHP (for API handling in Data.php)
Progressive Web App (PWA): manifest.json
Database: MySQL or any database for storing user data and prompts (can be configured in Data.php)
